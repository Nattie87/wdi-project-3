This was my first group project at General Assembly. Myself and my three project members decided on an authenticated Angular app that lets the users offer and carry out tasks for others. My role was more of a front-end role where I did the design and styling of the website.

`Some Technologies` used: 
Express, Bcrypt, Gulp, Mongoose, Morgan, Gulp, Nodemon, Express JWT, HTML5, SASS, Bootstrap
